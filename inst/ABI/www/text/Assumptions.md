1.	The application only takes into account genetic distances, and does not use other information such as morphological characters or phylogenetic placements to determine taxonomic boundaries. However, the application can serve as a quick indicator, with recommendations on further steps to take.

2.	The genetic distances obtained from Chan et al. (2021) were mined from the NCBI database, and covers only certain groups of medically important helminths (5). Since the initial aim of Chan et al. (2021) was to assess and evaluate the ten genetic markers, only species (or genera in some instances) that had sequences for all the ten genetic markers were used for comparison. More details can be found in the publication.

3.	The data obtained assumes that the species identity for the sequences are correct based on the information from the NCBI database.

4.	Recommendations on further steps to take are subjective and should be dependent on the aim of the user. The recommendations in the application are based on the results obtained from the queried genetic distance, the utility and limitations for helminth molecular-based studies from the authors’ comparison of genetic markers, and the authors’ opinions.
